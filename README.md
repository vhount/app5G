# On The Road 5G project

Hello and welcome to the On The Road 5G app !

This is a little and hopefully fun app designed to find out where precisely are located 5G antennas, filtered by telecom providers  within Metropolitan France.

You can either :

enter your location  via the searchbar and adjust the search radius around the GeoPin on the map using the slider below
or, choose a french department from the dropdown menu

This is a fullstack project that aims to explore fundamental web development knowledge, problem solving ability and development workflow.

## The code
This is a MERN app : NodeJS with Express & MongoDB are used for the backend and ReactJS with React Bootstrap for the frontend. 
In the project, Mapbox as well as React Mapbox npm module are used towards the geodata and geolocalization functionalities.

### Running the intern project
Firstly, the npm packages need to be installed for both the client and server. To do this, cd into the directories from your command line and run `npm install` or `npm i` 

After the packages have been installed, you can now run both the client and the server:
* To start the server, open a command line, cd to Projet5G-Back directory and run  `node app.js`
* To start the client, open a separate command line window, cd to Projet5G-Client directory and run `npm start`
Enjoy :)
